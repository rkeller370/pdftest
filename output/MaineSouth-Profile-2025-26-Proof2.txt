District 207 reports a weighted and non-weighted grade point average on the transcript. GPA for all courses is calculated on a four-point scale. Accelerated and AP courses are given one additional bonus point. This is reflected in the weighted GPA.

Driver Education does not count in the GPA. In a Pass/NG course, a passing grade does not affect a student’s GPA. Beginning with the spring semester of 2020, a grade listed as NG provides no credit and has no GPA impact. An NG may be used under special circumstances such as an audited course, a withdrawn course due to extenuating circumstances or a failed course.

District 207 moved to an integrated math curriculum in the 2019-20 school year. In all courses in the integrated math program, students study content standards in the domains of Algebra, Functions, Geometry, Number and Quantities, and Statistics and continue to develop their proficiencies with the 8 Standards for Mathematical Practice. Math 3 Compression and PreCalc Compression courses go at a faster pace,“compressing” more content so that students are prepared for the skills and rigor of AP Calculus BC. All grades received in the integrated math program are unweighted.
