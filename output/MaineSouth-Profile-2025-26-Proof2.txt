# GRADING #

District 207 reports a weighted and non-weighted grade point average on the transcript. GPA for all courses is calculated on a four-point scale. Accelerated and AP courses are given one additional bonus point. This is reflected in the weighted GPA. Driver Education does not count in the GPA. In a Pass/NG course, a passing grade does not affect a student’s GPA. Beginning with the spring semester of 2020, a grade listed as NG provides no credit and has no GPA impact. An NG may be used under special circumstances such as an audited course, a withdrawn course due to extenuating circumstances or a failed course. District 207 moved to an integrated math curriculum in the 2019-20 school year. In all courses in the integrated math program, students study content standards in the domains of

## ALGEBRA, FUNCTIONS, GEOMETRY, NUMBER AND QUANTITIES, AND ##

Statistics and continue to develop their proficiencies with the 8 Standards for Mathematical Practice. Math 3 Compression and PreCalc Compression courses go at a faster pace,“compressing” more content so that students are prepared for the skills and rigor of AP Calculus BC. All grades received in the integrated math program are unweighted.
