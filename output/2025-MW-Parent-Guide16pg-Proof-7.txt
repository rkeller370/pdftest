Welcome from

Eileen McMahon Dear Students, Parents, and Caregivers, Within this booklet, you will find important information about 9th grade. As you learn about the specific details that will help shape your choices for the next four years, I also hope that you are able to see within these pages the most important information of all: this is a high school that cares deeply about students, and we will do everything we can to help students find success.

For students reading this book, your job is to discover what you love and to start thinking more about what a meaningful life will look like for you. Our job is to make sure that you have the experiences and skills that you will need to decide what that meaningful life will be, and to go out into the world and make it real. Your first step on this journey is to read this book. It contains all of your options for mapping out where you might want to go.

For parents reading this book, we ask that you partner with us in your child’s educational journey. Talk with them about what they like and don’t like in their classes and clubs; support them in making good choices and persisting when they face challenges; contact us when you need help or have questions along the way.

We’re here to work together with you for the same goal: your student’s growth, well-being, happiness, and sense of purpose.

On behalf of the entire Maine West staff, welcome. We can’t wait to meet this incoming class of students and parents. We look forward to being a part of the wonderful things students will make happen here. Great things are waiting at Maine West High School.

Go Warriors,

Eileen McMahon, Principal

Attendance

District 207 has set a clear expectation that all students maintain at least 95% attendance, which means missing no more than two days per month.

Strong attendance builds academic achievement, purpose and long-term success.

Why Daily Attendance Matters: Being present in class each day is more than just showing up. It is about building a sense of belonging, forming meaningful connections with teachers and peers, and developing the consis- tent habits that are key indicators of success in school and beyond. Regular attendance ensures that students don’t miss out on the discussions, collaboration and hands-on learning experiences that can’t be replicated outside the classroom.

It creates stability and routine, helping students manage responsibilities, balance priorities and prepare for the expectations of college, careers and adulthood.

Daily Expectations for Athletic + Extracurricular Participation: The district strongly supports clear attendance expectations because they ensure that students are prioritizing their learning while also enjoying the many opportunities our schools provide. In order to practice, perform, or compete in athletics, extracurricular activities, and fine arts programs, students are expected to be present in the building for at least half of the school day. This balance reflects our belief that academic engagement comes first, and that participation in activities should grow out of a strong commitment to the classroom.

Attendance and Social Privileges: Our schools offer rich experiences and meaningful privileges that add to the high school journey, and access to these opportunities is connected to daily attendance. Attendance, engagement and learning are all interconnected, which is why students who wish to participate in events such as homecoming, prom, senior celebrations, parking privileges, and even attending athletic events as a spectator are expected to be present and on time each day. Linking attendance to these privileges reflects the district’s belief that showing up consistently is an essential part of a student’s responsibility to their school community.

Accountability and Consequences: If an absence occurs, parents and guardians are expected to contact the school the same day so timely support can be provided. Students are also expected to communicate with teachers about missed learning and deadlines for submitting assignments.

For unexcused absences, students are required to make up the missed time through serving deten- tions, completing assigned work or participating in other accountability measures to ensure they recoup lost learning opportunities. Tardiness and unexcused absences carry clear consequences, underscoring our shared commitment to valuing instructional time.

Together for Success

The district has created systems that recognize, respond and support strong attendance habits.

By working together, we can ensure that every student is not only present, but also fully engaged in their learning.

### DISTRICT 207 ###

### ENROLLMENT ###

Students are required to be enrolled in District 207 in order to access the course selection meeting with a high school counselor. Parents/guardians should complete enrollment prior to December 19, 2025.

Enrollment is for incoming 9th grade students ONLY and does not require a login or email address at this time. During enrollment you will receive an important application number. It is important to write this number down and keep it for future reference.

A link will be emailed to all incoming parents in November with directions and more information about enrollment. If you did not receive the enrollment email and need assistance with enrollment, you can email enroll@maine207.org or text 847-220-4202.

While the deadline is December 19, 2025, parents/ guardians are encouraged to complete enrollment as soon as possible. By completing the enrollment process for your child now, District 207 will be able to communicate relevant information regarding the 2026-27 school year, including important dates, course selection and counselor meetings.

### REGISTRATION ###

Registration occurs for all students each year in the spring. Students must be registered, and in many cases, prove residency in order to attend classes in District 207.

Initial enrollment in November and spring registration are two separate but essential steps to secure your child’s spot for the 2026-2027 school year.

Please note that registration for the regular school year requires access to the Infinite Campus Parent Portal. If a parent has forgotten their password or doesn’t have a verified email address, please utilize the “Forgot Password?” tool on the login page in the Infinite Campus Portal. The page can be found by visiting the District website and selecting “About” then selecting “Infinite Campus” or by scanning this QR code.

### FEES ###

Parents/guardians can pay school fees online as a part of the registration process in the spring.

Parents/guardians can also drop off payment at the school or send a check to the school at: Maine West H.S., 1755 S. Wolf Road, Des Plaines, IL 60018 or call the bookstore at 847-803-5878.

Parents/guardians in need of support with free/ reduced price meals and fee waivers may visit the school website at the start of registration for an application for next school year. They can also contact the school for more information at 847-692-8509.

### RESIDENCY ###

District 207 contracts with an outside vendor to verify the residency of all students. The reason District 207 verifies each student’s residency is to ensure that we are in compliance with state law and to fulfill our obligation to District 207 taxpayers that we allocate our resources to educate students who are legitimately entitled to attend our schools.

Parents/guardians found to be sending a child to District 207 schools and not living in the school district boundaries will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

Parents/guardians who have residency verified through the process will receive a letter stating that information and sharing that no further action is needed. Parents/guardians who receive a letter asking for more information regarding residency will be required to submit all paperwork to the Student and Family Services Office by the deadline indicated in the letter.

If residency changes during the course of the school year, parents/guardians will need to inform the Student and Family Services Department of the change of address.

### OPTIONAL ATTENDANCE AREA ###

Families who live in one of the two optional atten- dance areas within District 207 must make a deci- sion on which school will be the child’s home school on or before December 19 as part of enrollment.

For any student enrolling after the December 19 deadline, the home school must be chosen at the time of enrollment.

Once the “home school” decision is made, this is a one-time final designation and a family may not change enrollment to the other school within the optional attendance area.



[PAGE 6]
### STUDENT AND FAMILY SERVICES ###

The Student and Family Services team helps students make decisions and choices that will allow for success in high school and beyond. Student and Family Services works with students, families and staff in supporting students’ academic, social-emotional and career development throughout high school. Student and Family Services implements a range of supports for students and families including monitoring student progress data, social and emotional groups, course selection, career advisement and counseling services in preparation for college and careers.

Parents/guardians are encouraged to contact their child’s school counselor whenever the parent/guardian needs additional information about their child’s progress in school. The counselor has access to many supports to assist parents/guardians and can help make connections with the right individuals in the school when needed.

While the Student and Family Services Department anticipates the needs of students, the most effective way for the department to support families is to create an open communication between home and the school.

### SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH CENTER ###

The School-Based Health Center (SBHC) is available to any student at Maine East, typically at no cost.

There is a SBHC location at both Maine East and Maine West and is a partnership between Maine Township High School District 207 and Advocate Medical Group, in affiliation with Advocate Lutheran General Hospital. The goal of the SBHC is to improve the physical and emotional health of students attending Maine East, Maine South, Maine West and Frost Academy.

The SBHC is a comprehensive primary care program linked to community-based services. The SBHC is one of many SBHCs across the country. A SBHC provides medical and mental health screenings and treatment for young people who might otherwise not have access to primary care. School-based health centers have proven to be successful vehicles for addressing the challenges of adolescent health care. They are designed to be accessible, affordable, confidential and teen friendly. More information on school-based health centers can also be found from the School-Based Health Alliance and EverThrive Illinois.

The District 207 SBHC is open Monday through Friday during regular school hours as well as limited summer hours.

All components of the form including the Health History must be filled out, signed and dated. Please note that a sports physical cannot take the place of the 9th grade required physical.

By May 15 of their 9th grade year, students are required to have a dental exam on file. School dental examinations must have been completed within 18 months prior to the May 15 deadline.

District 207 discourages taking any medications at school. However, if a student must take medication, including over-the-counter products such as Tylenol, an Authorization and Permission of Medication Form must be completed by both the parent/ guardian and the attending physician, as well as be on file in the Health Office.

### CAREER ADVISEMENT ###

The goal for our nationally-recognized career advisement program is simple: support each of our District 207 students to help “get it right” for them in charting a course for success. Watch our short video about the career advisement journey for a student in District 207 by visiting bit.ly/207careerjourney or by scanning this QR code.

The work begins with each incoming 9th grade student through the formation of an Individual Career Plan. This plan helps each student find meaningful career experiences like job shadowing, mentoring, internships and apprenticeships based on research. When students get to experience career fields of interest they will make better informed decisions before spending time and money going down an education path that is not a match or one that is not recommended by the industry of interest.

Through return-on-investment counseling and up-to-date data to help best inform students and parents/guardians on the full analytic projections of career paths, District 207 is committed to help lower the cost of post-high school education as well as decrease the amount of time spent searching for a good career match and time spent obtaining the needed education. Students who know why they are going to school have a better chance of success.

Parents can learn more about the career advisement program by visiting https://maine207.org/career-explora- tion/ or by scanning this QR code.

### SCHOOLINKS ###

SchooLinks is District 207’s online school platform for all things career and post-secondary planning. From discovering interests and personality traits to discovering career possibilities to applying to postsecondary certification programs and universities, SchooLinks is a one-stop shop to help students prepare now for life during and beyond high school.

Every District 207 student will be provided an account in SchooLinks at the start of their 9th grade year and will be supported through advisory on how to access all of the immersive features within the platform. Parents/guardians and students can start exploring SchooLinks by visiting our course catalog.

### PLACEMENT GUIDELINES ###

The schools utilize several data points to place students in courses during their 9th grade year. Listed here are the guidelines for several curricular areas to give parents/guardians an idea of how those decisions are made.

English Core Courses

English uses a Competency Based Education model.

All students take English 1 as 9th graders and English 2 as 10th graders. Some students may be enrolled in other courses to meet their needs through a Special

### COURSE PLACEMENT AND ###

### ELECTIVE COURSE REQUESTS ###

Incoming 9th graders have the opportunity to explore a variety of courses offerings, including core content areas, electives and career pathway options. Please note that students must complete the enrollment process before they can begin selecting their courses.

The typical 9th grader will take a course in each of the following curricular areas: English, math, science, health & wellness and social science.

In addition, students have the option to choose to take two courses from among many other curricular areas during 9th grade including but not limited to: career & technical education, fine arts and world languages.

Education or Multilingual English course (which is decided by the IEP or Multilingual team). All courses in the TBE/TPI programs are aligned to curricular content areas - English, Math, Science, Social Science, Health and Wellness.

Learning Lab Support

In addition to core courses, some students will be supported through a period of Learning Lab in their schedule. This full block period will be divided into two halves, where students receive targeted support in the development of reading skills and/or executive function skills. Within the Learning Lab, students can access up to two half blocks of support, approximately 40 minutes each.

### GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS ###

In order to graduate from the District 207 high schools, students must earn a minimum of 22.75 units of credit. In addition to fulfilling the credit requirements, in order to obtain a district diploma, students must take the state mandated high school accountability exam.

More information is available by visiting the district website and selecting “Academics” then “Graduation Requirements” or by scanning this QR code.

[PAGE 11]


For reading support, students are selected based on standardized assessments from middle school, such as MAP or iReady. Initial recommendations may be adjusted based on winter and spring performance. Once students begin high school, Star Reading scores are utilized. Executive functioning support is provided if there are needs identified by Student and Family Services teams and/or IEP teams in the areas of organization, time management, work completion, etc.

These supports are designed to help develop the foundational skills needed to be successful in high school and beyond.

Mathematics Core Courses

We use an Integrated Mathematics model, and all students progress through the same initial sequence starting with Math 1, unless their needs are being met through a Special Education or Multilingual Math course (which is decided by the IEP or Multilingual team). Some students take one or two high school math courses during middle school, so they pick up the math sequence wherever they left off at the end of 8th grade. Most 9th graders will begin in Math 1. After completing Math 2 as a 10th grader students have an increasing number of choices each year as they progress through mathematics courses. Students are encouraged to choose classes based on their interests, needs and postsecondary plans.

Mathematics Support Programs/Courses In addition to their Math 1 course, some 9th graders will be supported through a program to further develop their Math skills. They may be scheduled for a full period of support via an elective credit-bearing course, or be offered support through programming during their study hall block.

Students are initially selected for these supports based on standardized assessments from middle school, such as NWEA MAP Math. Once they begin high school, we utilize the Star Math Assessment. Once course performance has been established at the high school level, grades are also taken into consideration.

[PAGE 12]


### THE POWER OF 15 ###

In today’s world of ever-changing technology and the rising cost of postsecondary certifications and degrees, we feel it is important for all students to access college-level coursework while in high school. Research supports that students who start earning college credit in high school are more likely to complete high school, enroll in college, acquire a degree and accumulate college credits to lower the overall cost of college.

In District 207 there are over 60 courses that can earn a student college credit so there is an opportunity for almost every student to earn college credit while in high school. Courses that carry the potential for college credit are labeled either Advanced Placement (AP) or dual credit/dual enrollment (DC) which are offered in cooperation with a college or university.

While even just one course helps in preparing a student for life after high school, many students can realistically earn 15 (one semester) to 30 (two semesters) worth of college credits.

Not all college credit-bearing courses are created the same. AP courses require a student to score a 3 or higher on the national test in May of each year and while all AP courses must be recognized and granted credit by Illinois colleges and universities, whether or not those credits count for core courses or as electives are at the discretion of the college or university. Dual credit courses require the student to achieve a grade of C or higher to earn college credit. Dual credit courses are transcripted by the college or university and are subject to evaluation by postsecondary institutions as well; however, courses that are designated as part of the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) must be accepted as core courses by colleges and universities in Illinois that participate in the Illinois Articulation Initiative.

What courses should our students plan to take while in high school? First, students should take courses in which they have an interest. A second consideration should be what courses have the greatest transferability to most colleges and universities (https://itransfer. org/aboutiai/). A third consideration should be, if you know the college or university you want to attend, how does the college or university value those courses and how your high school AP and dual credit courses are treated by that college or university. Below is a list of courses that are designated IAI or are an AP equivalent to the IAI course, in other words - taking either course satisfies an Illinois College or University course requirement. However, many more AP and dual credit/dual enrollment courses satisfy elective and/ or certification requirements at Oakton College. Be sure to see our website or see your counselor for more information
